/**
 * @brief Allows to manage the chat-related features of a MEGA account

 * You must provide an appKey to use this SDK. You can generate an appKey for your app for free here:

 *
 * To properly initialize the chat engine and start using the chat features, you should follow this sequence:
 *     1. Create an object of MegaApi class (see https://github.com/meganz/sdk/tree/master#usage)
 *     2. Create an object of MegaChatApi class: passing the MegaApi instance to the constructor,
 * so the chat SDK can create its client and register listeners to receive the own handle, list of users and chats
 *     3. Call MegaChatApi::init() to initialize the chat engine.
 *         [at this stage, if the app provided a session id, it can retrieve chatrooms and can operate in offline mode (INIT_HAS_OFFLINE_SESSION)]
 *         [If the app provided a email+pwd, it will enter into INIT_WAITING_NEW_SESSION and needs to wait for INIT_ONLINE_SESSION]
 *     4. Call MegaApi::login() and wait for completion
 *     5. Call MegaApi::fetchnodes() and wait for completion
 *         [at this stage, cloud storage apps are ready, but chat-engine is offline]
 *     6. The app is ready to operate when the callback onChatInitStateUpdate() notifies a valid
 *          session: INIT_ONLINE_SESSION
 *
 * Important considerations:
 *  - In order to logout from the account, the app should call MegaApi::logout before MegaChatApi::logout.
 *  - The instance of MegaChatApi must be deleted before the instance of MegaApi passed to the constructor.
 *  - In case we have init session in anonymous mode the app should call MegaChatApi::logout manually.
 *
 * In order to initialize in anonymous mode, the app will skip the steps 1, 4 and 5, but needs to perform steps 2, 3 and
 * 6 accordingly (but replacing the call to MegaChatApi::init by MegaChatApi::initAnonymous).
 *
 * Some functions in this class return a pointer and give you the ownership. In all of them, memory allocations
 * are made using new (for single objects) and new[] (for arrays) so you should use delete and delete[] to free them.
