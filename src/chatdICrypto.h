     * @brief msgEncrypt Encrypts a message, putting the contents in the specified
     * \c msgCommand object.
     * @param msg The message to encrypt. If msg.keyid is not 0, then it must be encrypted
     * with the key specified by that keyid. If it is 0, then it's up to the crypto module
     * to choose the key, and it must set msg.keyid to the id of the key used. It may decide
     * create a new send key, by calling Chat.setNewSendKey() with a newly generated key.
     * @param cmd The MsgCommand object that will be sent for that message. The
     * command object is fully configured with userid, chatid etc, and with a zero-length
     * message - i.e. the message length field is set to zero, and there is no message data.
     * When the encrypted message data is generated, setMsg() must be called on the
     * msgCommand object with the actual encrypted message data and the length of that data.
     * The keyid field of the command object is the same as msg.keyid when the method
     * is called, and if msg.keyid is 0 (i.e. it has to be set by this method),
     * it must also update the command's keyid to the same value - the keyids of the Message
     * and MsgCommand object must always be in sync.
     * The current encryption key is kept in \c Chat.currentSendKey. If the crypto module
     * generates a new key, it must call \c Chat.setNewSendKey() with the new key, which
     * will immediately post the unconfirmed key (i.e. with no keyid yet) to the chat. The
     * keyid of currentSendKey will be set to Key::kUnconfirmedId (0xfffffffe).
     * Upon key confirmation from the server, the id of currentKeyId will be updated to the
     * server-assigned keyid. The crypto module should not care about the key's id,
     * it should just use whatever \c Chat.currentKeyId.id() is set to.
     * @return Whether the encryption was successful.
     * In case a participant's public key is not immediately available (and needs to be
     * fetched from the API), \c false must be returned. When the key fetch is done and
     * the encrypt operation will be successful, the crypto module must call
     * \c Chat::onCanEncryptAgain(). This will result in \c encrypt() called again
     * for that same message, and for any subsequent messages that may have accumulated
     * in the output queue, until the queue is empty, another(or this) \c msgEncrypt()
     * call return \c false, or the connection goes offline. Upon a subsequent call for the
     * same message, it is not guaranteed that the keyid that this method set in the previous
     * call for the Message and MsgCommand objects will be preserved, so it has to be set
     * again on both objects in case \c msg.keyid == Key::kUnconfirmedId.
     * @note Event if it returns false, this method may still generate a new key and call
     * \c setNewSendKey(). The benefit would be that the server may confirm the key until
     * the pubkey is obtained from the API, thus allowing the usage of a real keyid for
     * that message instead of the 0xfffffffe keyid.
