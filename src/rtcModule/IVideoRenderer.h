 * application for rendering in the GUI, or other purposes. For each frame, getImageBuffer()
 * is called, then image is written to that buffer in 32bit ARGB format, and frameComplete()
 * is called, signalling to the application that the frame is written to the buffer.
 * A user pointer can be provided by the application to associate the two calls. It could
 * be just the raw buffer pointer, so that \c frameComplete() can use and free it, or
 * \c getImageBuffer() can allocate a high-level bitmap object and return
 * its internal image buffer. In that case the application needs to also associate a pointer
 * to that bitmap object (rather than to the raw memory) so that it can use and free
 * the high-level bitmap object properly.
