/** The Gui Call Marshaller mechanism supports marshalling of a plain C function
 * call with signature \c void(void*) together with an arbitrary data stuct.
 * The function pointer is the first member of the struct, and a C struct having
 * only that member is typedef-ed as megaMessage. Adding data members to the structure is
 * done by deriving in C++ from the megaMessage struct. The \c void(void*) function
 * is called the \c handler.
 * As both the handler and message structure are normally provided at the same
 * place in user code (or even done automatically by e.g. a templated function),
 * the handler knows the actual type of the structure, so it can cast it to the
 * proper \c megaMessage-derived type and access the additional data after the
 * \c megaMessage header. In other words, this is polymorphism in plain C,
 * and this API is plain C to make possible interoperation
 * between modules built with different compilers, even different languages.
 *
 * All memory associated with the message object is managed on the same side of the
 * DLL boundary - the one that posts the message. It is that side that allocated
 * the memory for the message object, and only it knows its exact type.
